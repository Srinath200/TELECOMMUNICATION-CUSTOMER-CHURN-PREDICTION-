# Telecommunication-customer-churn-prediction
 The field of communication technology is one that is competitive nowadays. The biggest problem currently facing practically all telecommunications industries worldwide is customer churn. In the context of telecommunications, "churn" is described as the process by which customers leave a business and stop using the services it provides because they are unhappy with those services or because they can find better options from other network providers at prices they can afford. This raises the possibility of the corporation losing money or profit. Retaining consumers has also become a difficult task. Thus, businesses are working hard to introduce cutting-edge applications and technology so they can provide their clients with the best services available and keep them as long as possible. Because losing them would result in a large loss of earnings for the business, it is vital to identify those clients who are likely to leave the company in the near future in advance. Churn Prediction is the name of this procedure.

According to studies conducted over the previous few years, data mining techniques are more useful for anticipating client attrition. The creation of an efficient churn prediction model is a significant task that requires extensive research, starting with the identification of the best predictor variables (features) from the vast amount of customer data that is available to the choice of an efficient predictive data mining method that is appropriate for the feature set. In addition to the network data that they generate, the telecom industries also gather a vast quantity of information on their clients, such as Customer Profiling, Calling Patterns, and Democratic data. It is possible to determine a customer's perspective regarding whether or not they will leave based on their history of behavior and calling patterns. According to studies conducted over the previous ten years, data mining techniques are more efficient at predicting turnover. It is frequently discovered that predictive modeling techniques, in particular, are more accurate at predicting churn.

In this study, we analyze the churn prediction literature from three angles: datasets, methodologies, and metrics. Initially, we go over the specifics of the public datasetâ€™s accessibility and the types of consumer information each collection contains in order to forecast customer churn. We then statistically analyze the results of the various predictive modeling techniques that have been employed in the literature to forecast customer churners using various types of customer records. Lastly, we provide a summary of the performance indicators that have been applied to assess the effectiveness of the current churn prediction techniques. For telecom firms to design a more effective churn prediction system, it is imperative to analyze all three perspectives.

#Deploymeent
 
Deploying a machine learning model simply refers to integrating the model into an already-existing production environment that can accept an input
and produce a useful output for business decision-making. One component of the data is the model that is built/trained using different techniques on a large
dataset. However, implementing machine learning in the actual world requires two steps, the first of which is employing these models in various applications.
The model needs to be deployed online so that users from the outside world can use it in order to forecast the new data. With the help of streamlit, a web
application was built utilizing the machine learning model. We will build a  simple HTML webpage to accept the measurements as input and classify the 
variety based on the classification model. Although there are competing frameworks on the market, such as FastAPI, streamlit is one among the most 
popular and well-respected framework among machine learning experts for deploying models.Using straightforward Python scripts, Streamlit enables you 
to develop apps for your machine learning project. Hot reloading is also supported, allowing your app to update in real time as you change and save 
your file. Using the Streamlit API, an app may be created in just a few lines of code (as we'll see below). Declaring a variable and adding a widget are the 
same thing. Writing a backend, specifying many routes, or managing HTTP requests are not necessary. It is simple to deploy and control.

#Conclusion

Customer retention is essential in a market that is competitive. This project used a genetic approach to implement hyperparameter adjustment in the Random 
Forest Classifier while taking the dataset into account. According to the telecom customer churn prediction model built using a random forest method with 
genetic algorithm tuning, churn can be anticipated when customers are dissatisfied with the service that is being delivered. The model achieved 80% 
accuracy. Also, as our findings indicate that customers with short contracts are more likely to churn, the telecom sector should make a compelling offer to entice 
customers to sign up for one or two years. Since our findings indicate that fibre optic service subscribers are more likely to churn than other consumers, the 
telecom sector ought to offer a good discount to these customers. The telecom sector should steer clients towards using mailed checks, bank transfers, or credit 
cards instead than electronic check methods for paying financial receivables. The findings demonstrate that customers who use electronic checks as their primary 
form of payment are more likely to leave. Since customers who are not provided with technical help are more likely to leave a telecom company, the industry 
should pay greater attention to this area.

#Future Enhancement

Using hybrid classification algorithms, future research in this area will concentrate on the connections between client lifetime value and churnprediction
that already exist. By selecting the appropriate datasetvariables, it is important to consider the retention policies. Due to the passive and dynamic nature of the
sector, data mining will play a bigger role in the future of the telecommunications business.
